## Generic â€“ Everything should look uniform

The generic advice is as follows: write new code in the same way the existing code is written.

If something isn't explicitly specified, it doesn't mean it's not important.
The naming of files, functions, CSS classes, formatting, and even the order of
attributes are all important and should follow the same systematic approach.
It's just not written down.

## Natural Pairs

- construct/destruct
- create/destroy
